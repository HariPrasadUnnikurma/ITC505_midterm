# Addendum â€“ ITC505 Mid-Term Project

## Process and Creative Choices
I designed an interactive story titled *Whispers on Willow Lane* using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I began by mapping out the story structure with multiple choices and at least eight possible endings.  
The story was coded in an object-based format, allowing each node to contain text, options, and images.  
I used event listeners to dynamically update the story content and change images as users made choices.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Some story paths ended too early.  
  **Solution:** Added extra mid-scenes (`open_parcel`, `deliver_parcel`) to make the game longer.  
- **Challenge:** Syntax errors and blank screens during testing.  
  **Solution:** Used browser console to locate syntax issues and fixed commas/semicolons.

## Insights Gained
This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, dynamic content updates, and JavaScript objects.  
I also learned to debug syntax errors and deploy projects using GitHub Pages.
